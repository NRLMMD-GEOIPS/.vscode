Settings for a consistent GeoIPS VSCode Workspace

This repository can be cloned parallel to your GeoIPS plugin repositories, and used for WorkSpace level VSCode settings across all GeoIPS plugins.

Ie:
* GeoIPS Plugin Repositories all contained under $GEOIPS_PACKAGES_DIR
* Clone .vscode into $GEOIPS_PACKAGES_DIR
* Open the folder $GEOIPS_PACKAGES_DIR from within VSCode.

This will ensure all plugin repositories contained under $GEOIPS_PACKAGES_DIR will use the same linting and formatting settings within VSCode.
